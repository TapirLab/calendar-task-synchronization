3. Enter a task subject. The subject should not include any ":" (colons).
4. Specify the description of the task, then, press enter and start a new line.
    * If the first line includes only three "!" ("!!!"), it will not be synchronized!
    * To clarify, the first line should be in the form of "!!!\\n" to not to synchronize
5. Specify the time that you want to create your task on the Calendar as below:
    * dueHour=HH:MM:SS
    * For example, it should be "22:00:00" to create an event between 10 pm--11 pm.
6. Tasks should be assigned to one of the members.
    * If not, 'Not assigned to anyone' will be written into the explanation of the event.
7. Specify the “Finish Date” of the task.
